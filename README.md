# React Router v6 Navigation Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using wildcard paths (`/*`) in React Router v6.  The issue involves unexpected navigation behavior when transitioning from a route with a wildcard path to a route outside of that wildcard path's scope.

## Problem Description

The bug occurs in situations where a wildcard path is used in `Route` such as `/contact/*`, and then the user attempts to navigate to another route (such as `/about`) that's not a subpath of the wildcard path.  The navigation may fail silently or exhibit other unexpected behaviors, disrupting the application's navigation flow.

## Solution

The solution involves a careful review of the routing structure and route definitions. This issue typically highlights a problem in how routes are nested or handled, rather than an error in React Router itself.  Sometimes refactoring your routes is necessary to correctly handle navigation. One potential solution is to avoid wildcard paths unless absolutely necessary. A more structured approach to routing might be beneficial.
